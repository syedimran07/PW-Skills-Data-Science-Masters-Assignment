    "### Q1. What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \"Multithreading\" is a programming concept where multiple threads runs independently within the single process, allowing for parallel execution of tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is used to improve the performance of a program by executing multiple threads concurrently. It is particularly beneficial in scenarios where some tasks can be performed independently, allowing for parallelism and potentially faster execution. However, in Python, due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), multithreading is not always the most efficient way to achieve parallelism, especially for CPU-bound tasks. For CPU-bound tasks, multiprocessing might be more suitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"threading\" module is used to handle threads in Python. It provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for creating, managing, and synchronizing threads. The \"Thread\" class from this module is commonly used to create and control threads."
